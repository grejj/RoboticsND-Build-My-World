## Introduction
This project involves designing and building a Gazebo world for future projects.

## Structure
There are three main directories:

### 1. model
This folder contains the building model as well as a four-wheeled robot model.

### 2. script
This folder contains a script that uses a Gazebo plugin to print a welcome message when the world is launched.

### 3. world
This folder contains the world file that desribes the Gazebo world.

## Setup
First, install Gazebo and ROS on Linux.

Next, download/clone the repository to your local directory:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/grejj/RoboticsND-Build-My-World.git
$ cd RoboticsND-Build-My-World
```

To open the world within gazebo:
```
$ gazebo world/project1_world
```
